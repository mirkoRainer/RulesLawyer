Pathfinder 2E on iOS mobile
**PRs Welcome!**

Using React Native, this repo aims to recreate the Pathfinder Second Edition character sheet. This has largely been a learning exercise for me but I also would like to publish this app to the App Store once I have the basic features done.

## Development

-   Go to https://expo.io/ and install expo.
-   Clone this repo down
-   Run `yarn install`
-   Run `yarn start`
-   You should see Expo running in your CLI now.
-   You can now hit `i` to open an iOS simulator (if you're on Mac) or `a` to open Android simulator or `w` to open a web version
-   The android and web version are not the focus, so they may not look great (the iOS one doesn't look great yet either....)

Please use complete descriptive words for your variables and functions that express the intent of the variable or function. Use Pathfinder 2e specific language where possible to keep everything within context. https://dzone.com/articles/naming-conventions-from-uncle-bobs-clean-code-phil
