Pathfinder 2E on iOS mobile

Using React Native, this repo aims to recreate the Pathfinder Second Edition character sheet.

## Development
- Go to https://expo.io/ and install expo.
- Clone this repo down
- Run `yarn install`
- Run `yarn start`
- You should see Expo running in your CLI now.
- You can now hit `i` to open an iOS simulator (if you're on Mac) or `a` to open Android simulator or `w` to open a web version
- The android and web version are not the focus, so they may not look great (the iOS one doesn't look great yet either....)
