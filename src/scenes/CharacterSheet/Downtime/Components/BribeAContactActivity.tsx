            Requirements You’ve successfully Gained a Contact (see below).
            You offer a bribe to your contact to help the heist in some way. Attempt a hard or very hard Deception or Diplomacy check.
            Success The contact accepts the bribe and you gain 1 EP.
            Failure You believe you successfully Bribed your Contact and gained 1 EP, but in fact the contact informs the opposition of the attempted bribery, adding 1 AP to the infiltration. The GM can reveal that this Edge Point grants no benefit at any point during the infiltration, as befits the story.
            Critical Failure As failure, but adding 2 AP to the infiltration.</Text>
